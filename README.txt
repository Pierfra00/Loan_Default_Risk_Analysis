# Some directories might not work properly due to some problems while opened in different operating systems. I worked on macOS and this is a recurrent problem. 

# The directories I'm referring to are the ones in the read.csv() function at the beginning of the project and the data preparation R scripts and the images ones in the Rmd original file.

# I'm sorry about this inconvenience
