# Loan_Default_Risk_Analysis

The aim of this analysis is to examine the factors contributing to loan default risk and to construct predictive models using statistical learning methods. 

The methods employed include logistic regression, classification trees, and random forest. The performance of these models is evaluated to determine the most accurate prediction of loan default risk. The dataset, comprising 255,347 rows and 18 columns, encapsulated borrower features and the binary target variable indicating loan default. 

The data preparation phase ensured dataset integrity by addressing missing values and transforming categorical variables. Logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models were employed for analysis. Logistic regression models, Logistic Model 1 and Logistic Model 2, considered different predictor sets, emphasizing the trade-off between complexity and interpretability. 

Error rates revealed higher-than-expected rates, prompting cross-validation for a more robust evaluation. The decision tree model underwent a pruning process for interpretability. Random forest models, with full and reduced predictor sets, addressed overfitting concerns through k-fold cross-validation. Results highlighted Logistic Model 1’s superior accuracy, outperforming decision tree and random forest models. Model comparison, including error rates and additional metrics, showcased Logistic Model 1’s reliability. 

The analysis emphasized the interpretability-accuracy trade-off, advocating for Logistic Model 1’s pragmatic use in real-world scenarios.
